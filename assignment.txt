A user visiting the URL will first sign up for the application and be taken to the homepage(friends suggestion screen) once he clicks the sign-up button.

You must use Redux to manage states for the sign-in and sign-up.

Once the user is signed up able to sign in to the application

The following actions should be present in the application:

The application should have a proper login system using tokens(Token-based authentication).

After signing up, the user needs to select 10 categories.

Unless the user selects 10 categories he/she should not be able to proceed to the next page.
